### Description
The main challenge of this lab was to modify the AXI-4 Lite interface in the auto-generated file hdmi_text_controller_v2_0_AXI.sv, such that the information communicated from and to the CPU was stored in a BRAM instead of registers. A critical element was accounting for the BRAM's read latency. A mechanism similar to a counter was used to accomplish this. Additionally, the outputs of the read and written data were put into an always_comb block instead of the original always_ff block to resolve the issue where the values communicated through the software are off by 1 (an error encountered during the checksum test in the software driver). I supposed the reason behind this was due to the additional clock cycle delay caused by signals in an always_ff block. In retrospect, this could be solved potentially by taking its effect into account in the read delay mechanism, which would probably be a cleaner solution if the delay is indeed the cause of the error. Consequently, the outputting mechanism or control signals (eg. slv_reg_rden) in the always_ff block for read data would also need to be modified to carry out this solution. In particular, the control signals axi_rvalid and slv_reg_rden are especially crucial.
