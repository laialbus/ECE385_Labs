### Description
I did this Python project in 2022 by following the book $\textit{Python Crash Course 2nd edition}$ by Eric Matthes, which included a section that taught the readers how to develop the Arcade game Space Invaders using the Pygame library. Through this project, I learned the basics of project development, especially for games, which later helped me in the final project for ECE 385 (Digital Systems Laboratory).
