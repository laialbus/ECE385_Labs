### Description
For Lab6.2, a significant amount of work was done in understanding the provided software driver, which was adapted from [Mazurov's lightweight-usb-host repository](https://github.com/felis/lightweight-usb-host), and how it fitted into the System on Chip built in the hardware.

For the hardware, a few modifications were made to the provided files, enabling a ball to move on screen with a frame rate of approximately 60. Then, the ball.sv module allowed users to control the ball's motion with W, A, S, D keys, corresponding to up, left, down, and right, respectively.
